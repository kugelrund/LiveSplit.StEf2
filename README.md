LiveSplit.StEf2
=================

LiveSplit auto splitter for Star Trek: Elite Force 2. Can also pause LiveSplits game timer while in loading screens.

Installation
-------------------
Enter "Star Trek: Elite Force 2" in LiveSplit's splits editor and click activate.

Usage
-----
Move the events that you would like the autosplitter to split on into the left list. The events are sorted by the order in which they occure. Keep in mind that you will have to setup your splits accordingly.
##### Pause game time
If you activate this option, the autosplitter will pause the game time when the game is loading, or in the main menu etc. This does not affect the realtime at all.
